[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/trixnz/lua-fmt.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/trixnz/lua-fmt) [![NPM Package](https://img.shields.io/npm/v/lua-fmt.svg)](https://www.npmjs.com/package/lua-fmt)

# Code Formatter for Lua
`lua-fmt` is pretty-printer for [Lua](https://www.lua.org/) code, written in [TypeScript](https://www.typescriptlang.org/) and deeply inspired by [prettier](https://github.com/prettier/prettier). `lua-fmt` provides an interface to format Lua code that conforms to a single and consistent standard.

While not implemented yet, the interface will be customizable to tailor the output to the user's preferences: linebreaks, string style, etc.

## Installing
* `npm install lua-fmt`

## Usage
### API
```TypeScript
import {formatText} from 'lua-fmt';
console.log(formatText('local hello = "Hello"; print(hello .. " world!")'))
```

### Command Line
Format a single file:
* `luafmt test/lua-5.3.4-tests/calls.lua`

Format a stream from `stdin`:
* `cat test/lua-5.3.4-tests/calls.lua | luafmt --stdin`

## TODO
- [ ] Add support for a `.luafmt` preferences file

## Testing
`lua-fmt` uses [jest](https://facebook.github.io/jest/) for automated testing (`gulp test`).

Among the user-created tests in the `test/` folder, a copy of the `lua-5.3.4` tests are executed after formatting to ensure the code remains syntactically correct after formatting. For this reason, please do not modify the `lua-5.3.4-tests` folder unless updating with new tests from the official Lua tests. To run these tests, `lua53` is expected to be available on the `PATH`.

When contributing changes, please consider writing tests to ensure they do not regress.
